#  node-express-mongodb-app

### Install project
```npm install```

### Run project
`npm run start` / `node server.js`, or to watch `nodemon server.js`


### Deployed with Heroku with these steps:

Create a Heroku app:
```heroku create```

You can use the git remote command to confirm that a remote named heroku has been set for your app:
```git remote -v```

If remote is missing but you have created an app already, you can do:
```heroku git:remote -a name-the-sprint-or-watever-git-repository-name```

Add and commit your app the the git repo, then push (master) branch to Heroku with:
```git push heroku master```

The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:
```heroku ps:scale web=1```

Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. 
As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:
```heroku open```
